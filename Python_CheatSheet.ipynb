    "### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of indentation. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable when you create it; instead, the interpreter assigns the type based on the value you assign to the variable. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented and functional programming."

    "\n",
    "**Advantage:** Readability and Ease of Use\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is renowned for its clean and readable syntax, which makes it accessible for beginners and efficient for experienced developers. The language emphasizes readability and simplicity, allowing programmers to write clear and concise code. This readability facilitates collaboration and maintenance, as code is easier to understand and debug. The extensive standard library and vibrant ecosystem of third-party packages further enhance productivity, enabling rapid development and deployment of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantage:** Performance Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which generally makes it slower compared to compiled languages like C or Java. Python is an interpreted languageThis means it runs the code line by line, which can make it slower than languages like C or Java that are compiled into machine code (binary) before running."

    "Attributes are variables that belong to an object and store data about that object. They are defined within a class and are usually initialized in a special method called the constructor (__init__).\n",

    "_Inheritance:_ Creating new classes based on existing ones, allowing for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Polymorphism:_ Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class, enabling methods to operate on objects of different classes in a uniform way.\n",
